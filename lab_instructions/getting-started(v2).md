# Automate Document Processing using Azure AI Document Intelligence and Azure OpenAI
## Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours
## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will explore document processing using Azure services to streamline and enhance the management of various document types. The focus will be on leveraging Azure's capabilities for analyzing and extracting data from documents, whether in electronic or printed formats. The lab will cover the end-to-end process, including data extraction, sentiment analysis, language detection, OCR, and document classification. Participants will utilize Azure tools such as the Document Intelligence resource, Azure Functions for blob triggers, and AI Search for document analysis. Additionally, they will integrate their processed data with Azure OpenAI's ChatGPT LLM via a web application and Cosmos DB to assess and interact with the information effectively.

## Objectives
Use Azure services to automate document processing, including data extraction, sentiment analysis, OCR, and classification. They will integrate Azure OpenAI's ChatGPT and Cosmos DB to analyze and interact with the processed data through a web application.

- **Automate document processing using Azure Document Intelligence:** Explore how Azure services can be used to process documents by extracting and analyzing information from various file types, such as PDFs and images. Train document models via Azure Document Intelligence and integrate them with Azure OpenAI for intelligent data extraction and interaction.

- **Utilize your Data Set using OpenAI:** Learn how to upload custom data into Azure AI Foundry, interact with the Azure OpenAI model using the uploaded content, and deploy the AI as a web app. Additionally, capture and store conversation history in Cosmos DB for enhanced traceability and persistence.
  
## Prerequisites

Participants should have basic knowledge and understanding of the following:

- Familiarity with AI concepts.
- Experience with Azure cloud services, including how to navigate the Azure portal.
- Basic knowledge of programming languages commonly used with AI models, such as Python.
  
## Architecture

**Azure Document Intelligence** processes and extracts data from documents. **Azure Functions** trigger the document processing based on blob changes. **Azure Storage Account** stores the documents to be processed. **Azure AI Search** indexes and searches the extracted data. **Azure OpenAI Service** provides AI capabilities for natural language processing and generation. **Web Application** facilitates user interaction and displays the results of the AI processing. A storage mechanism stores chat history for viewing and analysis.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure Document Intelligence:** Document Intelligence in Azure is a service that uses AI to extract structured data from unstructured documents.
- **Azure Functions:** is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without having to provision or manage infrastructure. You can write code in various languages and trigger it based on events like HTTP requests, timers, or messages from queues or topics
- **Azure AI Search:** is a cloud-based search service that allows you to add search capabilities to your applications. It provides features like autocomplete, faceted search, and spell correction, making it easy for users to find relevant information.
- **Azure OpenAI:** is a service that provides access to OpenAI's powerful language models, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, through Azure's cloud platform. This allows developers to build applications that can generate human-quality text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.
- **Azure Web App:** is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications. It supports various programming languages and frameworks, and offers features like continuous deployment, scaling, and integration with other Azure services.
